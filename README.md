# PriceWise - Get the right value for your car

This project predicts the price of a car using the dataset which contains car brand, year of purchase, KMs driven, number of previous owners This is a very helpful tool for people who have a used car and want to know the actual value of the car and not be deceived by the lowered price offered at most retailers or traders


## Features Considered

1. name
2. year
3. selling_price
4. km_driven
5. fuel
6. seller_type
7. transmission
8. owner

## Algorithms Used

1. Linear Regression - Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.


2. Lasso Regression - Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean. The lasso procedure encourages simple, sparse models.
## Problem Statement

An Indian automobile company Horizon MotoCorp aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Indian market. The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car

2. How well those variables describe the price of a car based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.

## Business Model

You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
## Societal Benefits

Since the manufacturers would be able to sell the car at a cost efficient price, the consumers would also be receiving a better value for money. This model can also be used by people who are looking to sell their old cars and receive the maximum resale value. In general, selling or buying a car is a exhausting job but with our model, the same process could be done within minutes instead of getting multiple car inspections at different retailers.
## Dataset Used

Vehicle dataset on Kaggle

This dataset contains information about used cars.It can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
